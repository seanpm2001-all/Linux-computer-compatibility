Notes (from personal usage):

The first laptop was completely fine, although I wore the keyboard out in less than 10 months.

Some Linux utilities were broken by default, such as changing system sounds, and favoriting files/folders

The second laptop and the first laptop had excessive battery drainage issues

The second laptop had many graphical issues, and crashed very frequently. Installing Samba might have made this worse.

The second laptop incorrectly reported how much CPU a process was using, and the laptop always used 10-40% CPU at all times, resulting in quicker battery drainage
